## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this extension, please take a look at the issues or create a new one. If you'd like to create a new icon, please reference the [Symbols - File Icon Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/HYLMyRbIdSbIJQlqnd9pSN/Symbols---File-Icons?node-id=20521%3A84115&t=PyBzZOlVG5TXyEdx-1), you can make a copy or reference the styles used (tailwind). Please try to limit your colors to the ones used in existing icons before choosing a different color style.

When submitting a PR, please ensure you've tested the extension locally and ensure that your new icons appear correctly in the file tree view with your new file extension. Include a screenshot of your proposed icon in your PR.

## Configuration

You can configure which folders and files icons are displayed by using the following settings:

### Folders

```json
"symbols.folders.associations": {
    "{folder name}": "{icon name}"
}
```

And here is an example using this setting:

```json
"symbols.folders.associations": {
    "entities": "folder-assets",
    "infra": "folder-app",
    "schemas": "folder-purple"
}
```

### Files

```json
"symbols.files.associations": {
    "{file name}": "{icon name}"
}
```

And here is an example:

```json
"symbols.files.associations": {
    "app.module.ts": "nest",
    "*.service.ts": "nest"
}
```

_Note: For file names, you can use `*` to match all files with a specific file extension._
